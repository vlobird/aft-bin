# aft-bin
This is kind a fork of [whoozle's android-file-transfer](https://github.com/whoozle/android-file-transfer-linux).

I am just to lazy, to git-clone, build and install the prog for every fresh-install of my system.

So i compiled it once and write a 3 line shell-script for the "install".

## Install
Just run install with `./install`

## Run
After the "install" you can start aft from commandline:
Just type `android-file-transfer`

Or with your app-drawer


## Credits
All credits go to [whoozle](https://github.com/whoozle) for writing android-file-transfer.
